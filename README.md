## Introduction
I wanted to make more than one game, so I decided to build a game where you will have a small adventure but at the same time you need to win some minigames in order to progress in the adventure.

<a name="workflow"></a>

## Workflow
I divided the project in four stages:
- Plan the game
- Create github repository
- Coding
- Create presentation

## Organization
I used trello to organize and wrote all my ideas about the game before coding.
